# SUCCEED-IN-LIFE
This is my first repository.

WHO ARE YOU GONNA BE?
And if you'll notice ,i am not asking"WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO BUT WHO ARE YOU GONNA BE".
I'm asking you about"HOW YOU PLAN TO LIVE YOUR LIFE EVERYDAY".
How are you gonna respond when you don't get that job you had your heart set on?
For all of you who are gonna be teachers,what are you gonna do,if the students in your class next year just don't respond to your lessons?
For all of you going into business,How will you react when your boss gives you a goal that feels way to high?
see these are the moments that DEFINE us,Not the day you get the promotion,Not the day you win "Teacher Of TheYear".But the times that force you to claw and scratch and fight just to get through the day.The moments when you get knocked down and you're wondering whether it's even worth it to get backup.See those are the times when you got to ask yourself:"WHOM AM I GONNA BE?".
